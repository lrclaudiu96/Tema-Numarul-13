        HUNDREDS of protest letters against plans for now housing on green belt an have been handedin to a concil. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp The Hullbridge Action Group is against plans to build 500 homes in the village, including near Watery Lane, wich regularly floods. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp The group has said roads, schools and doctors surgeries would not support the extra pressure new houses woul put on the area. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp Yesterday, 400 letters of objection to the plans were handed over to ROchford District Concil. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp UnderGoverment policy, 250 homes must be built in Hullbridge by 2021 and another 250 after 2021. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp Jacqui Taylor, from the Hullbridge Action Group said: "We handed 400 letters in and we still want more. We had 1300 signatures on the petition and about 12 residents turned up."<br>
        &nbsp&nbsp At public metting earlier this month, more than 200 villigers turned out to question councillors about the scheme. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp The group has set up a Facebook site and they also plan to deliver leaflets to homes across the village over the weekend. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp They have also produced posters for residents to stick in their widow to show their objection. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp The deadline for written objection is April 30 and the group is encouraging people to continue to writte letters against the plans until the deadline. <br>
        &nbsp&nbsp Rochford District Council's head of plannig Shaun Scrutton , said: "The allocations development plan discussion and consultation document is at an early stage of preparation.Nothing is set in stone and we very much welcome the views and opinions of our residents, wich will all be very carefully considered." <br>
